# Chrome-T-Rex-Game-Using-EMG

The goal of this project is to use the Verilog programming language to port Google Chrome’s T Rex mini game
on an FPGA Basys 3 board. The objective is to make the game mechanics, aesthetics, and game rules as close
to the original version as feasible. Only one of the board’s input buttons will be used to reset the game; however,
the primary input will be collected from the EMG module through XADC and output to a 640x480 60FPS
display via the VGA connector.
